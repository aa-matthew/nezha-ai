I like your positive vibes. In fact this has given me sleepless night.

> Musiu:
Do you think Bybit will let itself trade like this and 26 will say stop trading? it would be a shot in the knee for them, that's why I think everyone will get airdrop!!!,that's my opinion

> J M:
Which is the correct version to buy on Coinbase wallet? I see two

😂😂😂😂😂😂 I understand you broo am not far from you too but let wait and see! Though bybit made it clear they will migrate only those who bought before Jan 7 .

> Crypto Boy:
Does anyone know what market cup PEPE2.0 had when he changed the contract?

> Shumpei:
15hours ago, my bybit advisor for vip member replied that she is busy until Feburary 5th owing to taking part in meeting, so she is not going to reply my question about the problem of our old pepe2.0 bought after January 7th. 
She conveyed this massage by auto-message.
Which is important meeting or our wallets?
I think bybit is the worst exchange and very dishonest now.

> Wizard Frog:
pepe2 will blow minds soon chart will have god candles

> Shumpei:
I sent new message to my personal bybit advisor for vip member.
The message is that if you can  not answer this problem now, please introduce any other advisor who can answer this problem.
I hope they will reply to my request.
 I want Bybit not to spoil our second chance.m
