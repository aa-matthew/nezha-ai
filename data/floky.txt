Dear Vikings,

It has come to our notice that scammers are on a rampage trying to leverage the launch of our sister token to scam unsuspecting Vikings.

It is VERY IMPORTANT that you know the following facts:

1. We will NEVER, ever DM you asking you to send us tokens, or connect your wallet to a website/app, or join a presale for the sister token, or give us any privileged access to your wallet or account. There is no presale for the sister token.

2. Our core team members won't DM you first. And even if we've had private conversations before, we would NEVER ask you for funds or any of the above. Several scammers have been impersonating Floki core team members to capitalize on the interest and hype around the new token. If any "Floki team member" DMs you ANYTHING about the new token, it is 100% a scammer.

3. THERE WON'T BE A NEW TG GROUP FOR THE SISTER TOKEN. Announcements and discussions about that token will happen in the Floki TG group. So ANY one inviting you to a group purported to be for the new token and asking you to buy any token prior to our announcements is a scammer. We will only make key announcements relating to this token on EXISTING Floki communication channels. Don't get scammed, please.

4. PLEASE update your Telegram settings so that noncontacts cannot add you to groups. If you don't, a lot of scammers are likely to add you to fake groups in an attempt to scam you and we would really hate for you to lose your money. 

So please stay safe and wait for announcements from our EXISTING official channels!

> I hunt butt:
Are these real time generated because this doesn't show on chain...?

> Izh:
How else it can be . 🫨🫨🫨

> Floki Bot:
1) Our TEAM will never DM you first.
2) Never connect your wallet to random websites that you don't trust, never share your seedphrase/private key with anyone!
3) Never share your gatecode, withdrawal QR code or any other private details with anyone!
4) If you are randomly added/invited to a TG Group it's 100% scam. 

If you joined a Telegram group or channel with a large audience, chances are somebody will try to add you to other groups that are very likely promoting SCAM/SPAM activities.

To protect yourself from such actions, do the following in your Telegram App: 
1️⃣ Go to:  Settings
2️⃣ Select: Privacy and Security -> Groups & channels
3️⃣ Select: Who can add me to group chats? -> My Contacts

🔓 This will protect you from unknown people adding you to groups and channels unwillingly.

Please note: individual accounts will still be able to send you a DM. Telegram has no privacy settings to block that; that is why we need you to be actively attentive to who sends you messages.

Brother. I’m a Floki and Token fan. I don’t play Valhalla and don’t have the intention to create my own token, still I have heavy bags in both. It’s completely normal to be eager to the Valhalla en Tokenfi launch because it gives more utility to the project, more value, more gains😁

Any info about grayscale?

> Georg Prime - FUD Killer:
/floki give info about greyscale

> Pranali:
Paper hand

> FlokiAIBot:
Grayscale Investments is a digital currency asset manager. They offer various cryptocurrency investment products, including Bitcoin Trust, Ethereum Trust, and many others. They allow investors to gain exposure to digital assets without the need to directly buy, store, or manage them. However, please note that Grayscale is not directly associated with Floki. If you have any specific questions about Floki, feel free to ask! 😊

18k BTC total, but they are not dumping all on market, some transactions goes on unknown wallets some on Coinbase. Still Coinbase sent out some of BTC to unknown.

Per day 400 Million dollar btc avg buying by BlackRock & Fadelity.
So it's transferring the asset fro Grayscale to Big Players of markets.

> Izhar Ishak:
Interesting. Since before ETF approval retail buy the rumors pumping BTC up. It means retail will mostly in profit not Grayscale once ETF approval by selling.

To make more profit, probably Grayscale dump BTC to shake out paper hands.. then GS buy the dip 🤔
