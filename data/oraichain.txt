We have provided the correct data for crypto com, but since exchanges are free to list any asset they want it is often up to their teams to get the info right. But rest assured, we’re in touch with their team to get the corrections processed.

🖼 📢 Proposal Discussion: Implementation of Oraichain DAO dApp for Enhanced Decentralized Governance

👨‍💻Proposed by: Cosmos Tech Hub Team from (HUST). 

Cosmos Tech Hub Team is proposing the implementation of a governance dApp on the Oraichain network, specifically designed to support CW20-based DAOs. 

🌟 Aiming to develop a comprehensive DAO mechanism for Oraichain, along with its many communities, such as ORAIX, AIRI and many to come, the team has developed a preliminary framework for demonstration at orai.cosmostech.io, aiming to improve community participation and governance.

📍Oraichain DAO Features:
- ORAIX DAO (Ready): Allows ORAIX token holders to create and vote on proposals.
- Single-sided staking for ORAIX
- Voting power is based on staked ORAIX
- Staking rewards as an incentive
- DAO Creation for Tokens on Oraichain

⚡️Future Development:
- DAO Treasury: Management of project assets within the DAO.
- Automatic Execution: Implementation of actions post-proposal approval.
- Cross-Chain Functionality: Enabling voting across different networks for enhanced accessibility

> Charles:
I mean seriously. Is it impossible or difficult to put oasis adress on Owallet ?

> Bea Doo | Will never DM you first:
Can confirm that the team is considering to find the best solution for this

> Cryptoon | SmartNodes:
This is what I was wondering myself as well

> Cryptoon | SmartNodes:
Why spend 80k on creating a DAO, that we can already setup one for free... Unless there is more to it then that

> Josh | Will never DM you first:
We don’t have this:

- ORAIX DAO (Ready): Allows ORAIX token holders to create and vote on proposals.
- Single-sided staking for ORAIX
- Voting power is based on staked ORAIX
- Staking rewards as an incentive
- DAO Creation for Tokens on Oraichain

> Cryptoon | SmartNodes:
I mean why do we need to have this build on Orai chain if we can simply create a DAO on DAODAO where we have all these features already?

> Josh | Will never DM you first:
It is also a more user friendly version than Mainnet in terms of creating proposals and overall layout

> Cryptoon | SmartNodes:
But that's already possible on DAODAO and afaik it's multichain

> Cryptoon | SmartNodes:
Have anyone even spoken to the daodao team?

> Cryptoon | SmartNodes:
I would hate to spend 80k on something that already exists or can be made for Orain very easy

> Carlito D:
How do you stake on KuCoin I don’t see an option. Thanks

> va' ndre':
in the earn section, 25% apr

> Common Cents Crypto:
I think KuCoin needs to update their info… Staking hasn’t been over 25% for a while. 

New staking rates are closer to 15%, which means KuCoin will probably offer 13-14% since staking rates were 26-27% when they offered 25%, if I remember correctly.

> Carlito D:
Found it. Says finished now

> va' ndre':
i'm getting 25%

It’s ended now tho. They only have a certain allocation

I see the NodeOps Integration prop is basically a 50/50 split. 

I’m not sure which way to go on this one and would love to hear some of your opinions (both for & against) to help me decide. 

My initial thought is “Hell yeah, let’s do this!” But seeing so many people against it, gave me pause. Is there something I’m missing? I’m curious why so many people are against this integration?

I checked Commonwealth, but there were only 2 comments & not enough insight to sway me one way or the other, so here I am, asking you.

> Rain ( NeveR dm FirsT ):
I assume this is a good strategy to aggregate. Unless there is something that these people who voted against can enlighten us?
